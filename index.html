<p>Please read the man-db manual, included in the manual subdirectory of this
distribution.  It contains configuration details and other aspects of this
manual pager suite that are not duplicated or relevant in this README.
Check manual/README for details of the formatters required.</p>

<p>Read docs/INSTALL.autoconf for generic options to configure.
Read docs/INSTALL.quick if you know all about man-db.
Read NEWS for visible changes since the last public release.
Read ChangeLog for details of recent source code changes.
Read docs/TODO for future plans.</p>

<p>The C source requires an ANSI C compiler.</p>

<p>As of May 13th, 2001, the last public release of the Filesystem Hierarchy
Standard proposed the root of the manual page hierarchy as <code>/usr/share' and
the root of the writable cat hierarchy as</code>/var/cache/man' for the purposes
of man-&gt;cat filename translation.  As such, the following are defined in
./include/manconfig.h.in:</p>

<h1>
<a name="define-fhs_cat_root----varcacheman---------required-by-fsstnd-" class="anchor" href="#define-fhs_cat_root----varcacheman---------required-by-fsstnd-"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>define FHS_CAT_ROOT    "/var/cache/man"        /* required by fsstnd() */</h1>

<h1>
<a name="define-fhs_man_root----usrshare-------------required-by-fsstnd-" class="anchor" href="#define-fhs_man_root----usrshare-------------required-by-fsstnd-"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>define FHS_MAN_ROOT    "/usr/share"            /* required by fsstnd() */</h1>

<p>For compatibility with the old FSSTND, the following locations are also
defined:</p>

<h1>
<a name="define-cat_root--------varcatman------------required-by-fsstnd-" class="anchor" href="#define-cat_root--------varcatman------------required-by-fsstnd-"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>define CAT_ROOT        "/var/catman"           /* required by fsstnd() */</h1>

<h1>
<a name="define-man_root--------usr-------------------required-by-fsstnd-" class="anchor" href="#define-man_root--------usr-------------------required-by-fsstnd-"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>define MAN_ROOT        "/usr"                  /* required by fsstnd() */</h1>

<p>Should these locations change, simply define the paths accordingly and
recompile.  Other FHS changes relating to man/cat paths will not be
compatible with this version of man-db.</p>

<h1>
<a name="non-generic-arguments-to-configure" class="anchor" href="#non-generic-arguments-to-configure"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Non-generic arguments to configure</h1>

<p>To allow the configuration program, configure, to be non-interactive, it can
be passed various options to alter the default settings.  Generic configure
options are discussed in docs/INSTALL.autoconf.  The following list of
options is extracted from the man-db manual.  It is strongly recommended
that relevant sections of the manual are read if any of these options are
used.</p>

<p>--enable-setuid[=ARG]
     By default, man will be installed as a setuid program to user man.  Use
     this option with an argument to change the setuid owner.</p>

<p>--disable-setuid
     Use this option to install man as a non-setuid program and to change the
     default cat and database files' access flags to allow users to modify
     them.</p>

<p>--enable-mandirs=OS
     By default, man-db supports manual page directories in any of several
     layouts used by free and proprietary versions of UNIX.  However, in
     certain cases, this can cause man-db to find the wrong page by mistake,
     especially when the names of some manual pages on the system contain
     periods.  Use this option with an argument of GNU, HPUX, IRIX, Solaris,
     or BSD (or more than one of these, separated by commas) to support only
     the layouts typically used on each of those systems.  Note that man-db is
     not currently capable of writing cat pages in the proper BSD layout.</p>

<p>--with-device=DEVICE
     Use this flag to alter the default output device used by NROFF. DEVICE is
     passed to NROFF with the -T option.  configure will test that NROFF will
     run with the supplied device argument.</p>

<p>--with-db=LIBRARY
     configure will look for database interface libraries in the order gdbm,
     Berkeley DB and finally ndbm and will #define appropriate variables
     relative to the first one found.  To override the built-in order on
     platforms having a choice of interface library, use this option to
     specify which library to use.</p>

<p>--enable-automatic-create
     If this flag is used, man will automatically create index databases for
     users' private manual page hierarchies.</p>

<p>--disable-automatic-update
     Normally, man will update entries in index databases if it finds newly
     installed manual pages (if the --update flag is used) or delete entries
     if manual pages are removed.  This flag suppresses this behaviour.</p>

<p>--disable-cats
     Normally, man will automatically try to create cat files corresponding to
     manual files when a manual page is read.  This flag suppresses this
     behaviour.</p>

<h1>
<a name="install" class="anchor" href="#install"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>INSTALL</h1>

<p>Running configure.</p>

<pre><code>o READ `docs/INSTALL.autoconf' regarding ./configure options

o RUN `./configure --help' to see what --enable and --with
  options may be useful.

o RUN `./configure' with the appropriate options and environment
  variable settings
</code></pre>

<p>BROWSE or EDIT the following files that were created by the configuration
process.</p>

<pre><code>o `include/manconfig.h' regarding paths to support programs,
  the default section list and other specific definitions.

o `include/comp_src.h' if the default compressor support is
  inadequate for your requirements.  (usually .Z [compress], 
  .z, .gz [gzip])
</code></pre>

<p>configure will determine your system's ability to use native language
support (NLS) message catalogues.  You may set the environment variable
LINGUAS to limit the set of translations installed.  LINGUAS should contain
a space-separated list of two-letter language identifiers.  To compile
man-db with no support for message catalogues, simply pass the --disable-nls
option to configure.  N.B. This is not related to man's ability to display
NLS manual pages, support for which is compiled in by default. </p>

<p>Running make.</p>

<pre><code>o RUN `make' to compile man-db with the set of translations chosen
  when running `./configure'.
</code></pre>

<p>Sort out the man-db configuration file.</p>

<pre><code>o RUN `./src/man -l man/man5/manpath.5' from the root of this
  distribution to read the man-db configuration file details.

o EDIT `./src/man_db.conf' to your local requirements.
</code></pre>

<p>Install the package.</p>

<pre><code>o (gain superuser privileges for the rest of the steps)

o RUN `make install' to install the utilities and manual pages.
</code></pre>

<p>Initialise the `index' databases for all manpaths marked as global in the
man-db configuration file.</p>

<pre><code>o RUN `mandb' (This step is equivalent to running straycats and 
  makewhatis too).
</code></pre>

<p>The following steps are optional / dependent on local conventions.</p>

<pre><code>o ACKNOWLEDGE any warnings emitted by mandb. Bogus manual pages
  are not included in the database and may be a waste of space.
  Those pages without correctly formatted `whatis' lines are
  included, but will have a whatis entry of "(unknown)"

o CD tools and RUN `mkcatdirs -t' to see if you have all of the
  required cat directories.  `mkcatdirs' without an option will 
  display a usage message.

o CD tools and RUN `checkman' with an argument of colon separated
  manual page hierarchies to cross check for duplicated manual
  pages.  If no argument is given, your default $MANPATH will be
  used.

  The output of checkman may be piped into a file and used as an
  argument to `rm', the `is newer than' messages are directed to 
  standard error.  e.g. `checkman &gt; dups'

  If you are confident that the duplicates found are indeed 
  duplicates, you can back them up and delete them to save space.

  At this point, running checkman again may yield further duplicates 
  that were ignored the first time.

o RUN `catman' with appropriate options to create any/all cat files
  that you would like pre-formatted.
</code></pre>

<h1>
<a name="multiple-build-directories" class="anchor" href="#multiple-build-directories"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Multiple build directories</h1>

<p>It is possible to build man-db in a directory other than the directory
containing this file (and all of the program sources).  This is particularly
useful if compiling on multiple architectures or testing various
configuration options as only a single copy of the sources is required.</p>

<p>To enable this support, simply change directory to where you would like to
build the package and run the configure program in this directory 
<em>from there</em>.  Further information about this support can be found in the 
generic install document `docs/INSTALL.autoconf'.</p>

<h1>
<a name="makefile-targets-and-variables" class="anchor" href="#makefile-targets-and-variables"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Makefile targets and variables</h1>

<p>The standard GNU Makefile targets: all, install, uninstall, mostlyclean,
clean, distclean, realclean and TAGS are available in every Makefile-
supported directory.  In addition, the master Makefile has the dist target
to create a compressed and tarred distribution file.</p>

<p>During the configuration process, <code>configure' sets the installation
variables,</code>prefix' and <code>exec_prefix'.  These are then used to form other
variables such as</code>bindir' and <code>sysconfdir'.  To change any of these or 
other standard GNU install variables dynamically, issue the</code>make' command 
with variable expressions as arguments, eg. `make prefix=/usr/local/packages'</p>

<p>N.B. If prefix=/usr (either statically or dynamically), then sysconfdir=/etc
instead of the usual $(prefix)/etc.  To force sysconfdir to be /usr/etc, set
it on the make command line.</p>

<h1>
<a name="default-preprocessors" class="anchor" href="#default-preprocessors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Default preprocessors</h1>

<p>man-db uses a manual page directed preprocessor system, that is, each manual
page may request preprocessing by a selection of preprocessors.  Some
systems' manual pages do not come with this information built in.  In such
circumstances, it is advisable to set a default list of preprocessors that
each manual page should be passed through, so that those requiring special
processing are readable.  To achieve this, set DEFAULT_MANROFFSEQ (found in
include/manconfig.h) to the appropriate preprocessor string, after running
configure, but prior to compilation.  This is not necessary for the
following systems whose default preprocessing requirements are known.</p>

<p>Known not to require DEFAULT_MANROFFSEQ:
    Linux, SunOS
  Known to require #define DEFAULT_MANROFFSEQ "t":
    Ultrix
  Known to require #define DEFAULT_MANROFFSEQ "te":
    HP-UX, OSF/1</p>

<p>If unsure of the default preprocessors required by a system, the standard
system's man(1) manual page may provide an answer. </p>
