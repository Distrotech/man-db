As such, the following are defined in\r\n./include/manconfig.h.in:\r\n\r\n#define FHS_CAT_ROOT    \"/var/cache/man\"        /* required by fsstnd() */\r\n#define FHS_MAN_ROOT    \"/usr/share\"            /* required by fsstnd() */\r\n\r\nFor compatibility with the old FSSTND, the following locations are also\r\ndefined:\r\n\r\n#define CAT_ROOT        \"/var/catman\"           /* required by fsstnd() */\r\n#define MAN_ROOT        \"/usr\"                  /* required by fsstnd() */\r\n\r\nShould these locations change, simply define the paths accordingly and\r\nrecompile.  Other FHS changes relating to man/cat paths will not be\r\ncompatible with this version of man-db.\r\n\r\nNon-generic arguments to configure\r\n==================================\r\n\r\nTo allow the configuration program, configure, to be non-interactive, it can\r\nbe passed various options to alter the default settings.  Generic configure\r\noptions are discussed in docs/INSTALL.autoconf.  The following list of\r\noptions is extracted from the man-db manual.  It is strongly recommended\r\nthat relevant sections of the manual are read if any of these options are\r\nused.\r\n\r\n--enable-setuid[=ARG]\r\n     By default, man will be installed as a setuid program to user man.  Use\r\n     this option with an argument to change the setuid owner.\r\n\r\n--disable-setuid\r\n     Use this option to install man as a non-setuid program and to change the\r\n     default cat and database files' access flags to allow users to modify\r\n     them.\r\n\r\n--enable-mandirs=OS\r\n     By default, man-db supports manual page directories in any of several\r\n     layouts used by free and proprietary versions of UNIX.  However, in\r\n     certain cases, this can cause man-db to find the wrong page by mistake,\r\n     especially when the names of some manual pages on the system contain\r\n     periods.  Use this option with an argument of GNU, HPUX, IRIX, Solaris,\r\n     or BSD (or more than one of these, separated by commas) to support only\r\n     the layouts typically used on each of those systems.  Note that man-db is\r\n     not currently capable of writing cat pages in the proper BSD layout.\r\n\r\n--with-device=DEVICE\r\n     Use this flag to alter the default output device used by NROFF. DEVICE is\r\n     passed to NROFF with the -T option.  configure will test that NROFF will\r\n     run with the supplied device argument.\r\n\r\n--with-db=LIBRARY\r\n     configure will look for database interface libraries in the order gdbm,\r\n     Berkeley DB and finally ndbm and will #define appropriate variables\r\n     relative to the first one found.  To override the built-in order on\r\n     platforms having a choice of interface library, use this option to\r\n     specify which library to use.\r\n\r\n--enable-automatic-create\r\n     If this flag is used, man will automatically create index databases for\r\n     users' private manual page hierarchies.\r\n\r\n--disable-automatic-update\r\n     Normally, man will update entries in index databases if it finds newly\r\n     installed manual pages (if the --update flag is used) or delete entries\r\n     if manual pages are removed.  This flag suppresses this behaviour.\r\n\r\n--disable-cats\r\n     Normally, man will automatically try to create cat files corresponding to\r\n     manual files when a manual page is read.  This flag suppresses this\r\n     behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALL\r\n=======\r\n\r\nRunning configure.\r\n\r\n\to READ `docs/INSTALL.autoconf' regarding ./configure options\r\n\r\n\to RUN `./configure --help' to see what --enable and --with\r\n\t  options may be useful.\r\n\r\n\to RUN `./configure' with the appropriate options and environment\r\n\t  variable settings\r\n\r\nBROWSE or EDIT the following files that were created by the configuration\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n\to `include/manconfig.h' regarding paths to support programs,\r\n\t  the default section list and other specific definitions.\r\n\r\n\to `include/comp_src.h' if the default compressor support is\r\n\t  inadequate for your requirements.  (usually .Z [compress], \r\n\t  .z, .gz [gzip])\r\n\r\nconfigure will determine your system's ability to use native language\r\nsupport (NLS) message catalogues.  You may set the environment variable\r\nLINGUAS to limit the set of translations installed.  LINGUAS should contain\r\na space-separated list of two-letter language identifiers.  To compile\r\nman-db with no support for message catalogues, simply pass the --disable-nls\r\noption to configure.  N.B. This is not related to man's ability to display\r\nNLS manual pages, support for which is compiled in by default. \r\n\r\nRunning make.\r\n\r\n\to RUN `make' to compile man-db with the set of translations chosen\r\n\t  when running `./configure'.\r\n\r\nSort out the man-db configuration file.\r\n\r\n\to RUN `./src/man -l man/man5/manpath.5' from the root of this\r\n\t  distribution to read the man-db configuration file details.\r\n\r\n\to EDIT `./src/man_db.conf' to your local requirements.\r\n\r\nInstall the package.\r\n\r\n\to (gain superuser privileges for the rest of the steps)\r\n\r\n\to RUN `make install' to install the utilities and manual pages.\r\n\r\nInitialise the `index' databases for all manpaths marked as global in the\r\nman-db configuration file.\r\n\r\n\to RUN `mandb' (This step is equivalent to running straycats and \r\n\t  makewhatis too).\r\n\r\nThe following steps are optional / dependent on local conventions.\r\n\r\n\to ACKNOWLEDGE any warnings emitted by mandb. Bogus manual pages\r\n\t  are not included in the database and may be a waste of space.\r\n\t  Those pages without correctly formatted `whatis' lines are\r\n\t  included, but will have a whatis entry of \"(unknown)\"\r\n\r\n\to CD tools and RUN `mkcatdirs -t' to see if you have all of the\r\n\t  required cat directories.  `mkcatdirs' without an option will \r\n\t  display a usage message.\r\n\r\n\to CD tools and RUN `checkman' with an argument of colon separated\r\n\t  manual page hierarchies to cross check for duplicated manual\r\n\t  pages.  If no argument is given, your default $MANPATH will be\r\n\t  used.\r\n\t\r\n\t  The output of checkman may be piped into a file and used as an\r\n\t  argument to `rm', the `is newer than' messages are directed to \r\n\t  standard error.  e.g. `checkman > dups'\r\n\r\n\t  If you are confident that the duplicates found are indeed \r\n\t  duplicates, you can back them up and delete them to save space.\r\n\r\n\t  At this point, running checkman again may yield further duplicates \r\n\t  that were ignored the first time.\r\n \r\n\to RUN `catman' with appropriate options to create any/all cat files\r\n\t  that you would like pre-formatted.\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiple build directories\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nIt is possible to build man-db in a directory other than the directory\r\ncontaining this file (and all of the program sources).  This is particularly\r\nuseful if compiling on multiple architectures or testing various\r\nconfiguration options as only a single copy of the sources is required.\r\n\r\nTo enable this support, simply change directory to where you would like to\r\nbuild the package and run the configure program in this directory \r\n*from there*.  Further information about this support can be found in the \r\ngeneric install document `docs/INSTALL.autoconf'.\r\n\r\n\r\nMakefile targets and variables\r\n==============================\r\n\r\nThe standard GNU Makefile targets: all, install, uninstall, mostlyclean,\r\nclean, distclean, realclean and TAGS are available in every Makefile-\r\nsupported directory.  In addition, the master Makefile has the dist target\r\nto create a compressed and tarred distribution file.\r\n\r\nDuring the configuration process, `configure' sets the installation\r\nvariables, `prefix' and `exec_prefix'.  These are then used to form other\r\nvariables such as `bindir' and `sysconfdir'.  To change any of these or \r\nother standard GNU install variables dynamically, issue the `make' command \r\nwith variable expressions as arguments, eg. `make prefix=/usr/local/packages'\r\n\r\nN.B. If prefix=/usr (either statically or dynamically), then sysconfdir=/etc\r\ninstead of the usual $(prefix)/etc.  To force sysconfdir to be /usr/etc, set\r\nit on the make command line.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefault preprocessors\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nman-db uses a manual page directed preprocessor system, that is, each manual\r\npage may request preprocessing by a selection of preprocessors.  Some\r\nsystems' manual pages do not come with this information built in.  In such\r\ncircumstances, it is advisable to set a default list of preprocessors that\r\neach manual page should be passed through, so that those requiring special\r\nprocessing are readable.  To achieve this, set DEFAULT_MANROFFSEQ (found in\r\ninclude/manconfig.h) to the appropriate preprocessor string, after running\r\nconfigure, but prior to compilation.  This is not necessary for the\r\nfollowing systems whose default preprocessing requirements are known.\r\n\r\n  Known not to require DEFAULT_MANROFFSEQ:\r\n    Linux, SunOS\r\n  Known to require #define DEFAULT_MANROFFSEQ \"t\":\r\n    Ultrix\r\n  Known to require #define DEFAULT_MANROFFSEQ \"te\":\r\n    HP-UX, OSF/1\r\n\r\nIf unsure of the default preprocessors required by a system, the standard\r\nsystem's man(1) manual page may provide an answer. \r\n\r\n\r\nContacting the maintainer\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nThe current maintainer of man-db is Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>.\r\nPlease feel free to contact me with any queries or problems you may have. If\r\nyou are using the Debian GNU/Linux or GNU/Hurd system, I welcome bug reports\r\nagainst the man-db package by way of the Debian bug tracking system\r\n(http://bugs.debian.org/).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
